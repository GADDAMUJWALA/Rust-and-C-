*C++ Code: Parallel Image Processing*

- *Input*: The input is an image file named "input.jpg" located in the same directory as the program. This image serves as the input for image processing operations.

- *Output*: After processing, the program generates a processed image file named "output.jpg" in the same directory. This output file contains the result of the image processing operations applied to the input image.

- *Explanation*: The program loads the input image, applies image processing operations (e.g., Gaussian blur) to each subregion of the image in parallel, merges the processed subregions into the final image, and saves the result as "output.jpg". The output file represents the processed version of the input image.

These explanations clarify the input and output scenarios for both the Rust and C++ examples. Depending on your needs, you can adjust the input data or modify the program logic to achieve different outcomes.
